# Block Win32 API calls from Office macro ASR Recovery Scripts

This repo contains sample PowerShell scripts, commands, and instructions to recover shortcuts (.lnk) impacted by the False Positive (FP) on Attack Surface Reduction rules (ASR Rules) - “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” rule turned on in **block mode**. 

Please begin by reading the blog here: https://aka.ms/ASRFPRecovery

Then read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) here: https://aka.ms/ASR_shortcuts_deletion_FAQ 

This repo contains information about the following scripts:
* AddShortcuts.ps1 - PowerShell script that attempts to restore impacted shortcuts based on information retrieved from VSS (shadow copy) and registry
* MpRecoverTaskbar.exe - Executable that attempts to restore taskbar links and libraries based on information retrieved from the registry

**Note:**  All of these scripts are signed by Microsoft

## AddShortCuts.ps1
This script provides a variety of techniques that can help recover links.
### Usage
```
AddShortcuts.ps1 [-Telemetry $false|$true ]  `
                 [ -ForceRepair ] `
                 [ -VssRecovery ] `
                 [ -MpTaskBarRecoverUtilDownload $false|$true ] `
                 [ -SkipBinaryValidation] `
                 [ -Verbose 0|1|2|3 ] `


Telemetry:                          Enable or disables having telemetry logging, default: true
ForceRepair:                        Repair is done irrespective of machine being considered affected or not, 
                                    default: true
VssRecovery:                        Use VSS recovery to restore lnk files, default: true
MpTaskBarRecoverUtilDownload:       Download the MpRecoverTaskbar.exe from the Microsoft Download Center, 
                                    default: true
                                    When this is false, the script assumes that MpRecoverTaskbar.exe resides in 
                                    the current working directory, default: true 
SkipBinaryValidation:               Skips validating the authenticity of MpRecoverTaskbar.exe whether download or 
                                    locally, default: false 
Verbose:                            Level of logging, default 1 
                                        0: No stdout and no log file
                                        1: Only stdout (default)
                                        2: both stdout and log file output
                                        3: detailed stdout along with log file output
```
### Fix links to software installed
The script iterates through ``` SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths ``` for both HKLM and HKU hives and looks for applications defined in the script. For those applications, a version is retrieved from the registry, and a shortcut is created in the appropriate Start Menu. This will run for all applications defined and in the registry, so customers may see new items added to the Start Menu.


### Adding additional applications
The script can be modified to include additional applications by adding an entry to the ```$programs``` variable.  

```
$programs = @{
    "Adobe Acrobat"                = "Acrobat.exe"
    "[Adobe Photoshop]"            = "photoshop.exe"
    "[Adobe Illustrator]"          = "illustrator.exe"
    ...
```

**Important:** ```$programs``` table is a key=value pair, with [] used to denote programs that have version year info, like [Visual Studio]. For such entries with [], we will lookup file description in file version info and use that, if it does not exist, we will fallback using generic name.

### Best effort to trigger RunOnce of MpRecoverTaskbar.exe 
The ```MpRecoverTaskbar.exe``` is a program that recovers taskbar data from the registry.  It needs to be run in user context, so the ```AddShortCuts.ps1``` simplifies this by adding it as a RunOnce to every user.  There is a best effort attempt to trigger RunOnce immediately for logged in users by impersonating their tokens.  This is only expected to work if the script is run from local SYSTEM account, and may work from an elevated administrator context depending on the local security policy.  Even if triggering the RunOnce is unsuccessful, then the .exe will run in the next time the user logs in.  Non logged on users will still have to log in to have the ```MpRecoverTaskbar.exe``` run.

The ```MpRecoverTaskbar.exe``` is either downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center or copied locally from the current working directory to the Windows directory.  Before copying the file to the Windows directory the script validates the authenticity of the binary, unless the SkipBinaryValidation is enabled.

### VSS Recovery (Optional)
If the script discovers VSS (shadow copy), then the shadow copies are mounted, and the following paths/extensions are restored if files exist

| Path | Extensions |
| ---- | ------     |
| \Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\ | .lnk |
| \ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\ | .lnk |
| %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\ | .lnk |
| %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ | .lnk |
| %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\ | .lnk  |
| %USERPROFILE%\Favorites\ | .url |
| %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\ | .url |
| %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\ | .lnk |

### Saving Results (Optional) 
For information about this tool, including data it stores to understand effectiveness, go to https://aka.ms/ASR_shortcuts_deletion_FAQ

### Best effort to trigger run once of MpRecoverTaskbar.exe (Optional)
The ```MpRecoverTaskbar.exe``` is added as a RunOnce to all users and there is a best effort attempt to run the .exe when the script runs.  If the script is unsuccessful, then the .exe will run the next time the user logs in.

# Deployment options
Here are a couple of deployment tools that can be used to push out the PowerShell script (AddShortcuts.ps1) and/or .exe's (MpRecoverTaskbar.exe).
* Intune (MEM, MDM) http://aka.ms/RestoreShortcuts-Intune
* System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM, MEMCM) https://aka.ms/RestoreShortcuts-SCCM

# How to check if your Windows 10 or Windows 11 machines are still running the impacted SIU:
In Advanced Hunting, you are able to run the following Advanced Hunting (AH) query to see if any of your devices require an updated version of the SIU: 
https://github.com/microsoft/MDE-PowerBI-Templates/blob/master/ASR_AdvancedHunting/Check_what_machines_have_the_bad_signatures

Once you confirm that the devices have an updated SIU, you can move the ASR Rules - “Block Win32 API calls from Office macro” rule to **block mode**.
